## MASTER DECISION TABLE

> Read this first. Every technology choice is justified — not just named.

| Decision | Recommendation | Alternatives Considered | Why This Choice |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Backend Framework** | FastAPI | Django, Flask | API-first + async-ready + Pydantic schemas + OpenAPI auto-docs. Ideal for ML workloads. Django's ORM/admin adds overhead we don't need. Flask requires too much manual scaffolding. |
| **Frontend Framework** | React 18 + TypeScript | Vue, Svelte, Angular | Widest recruiter familiarity, strong ecosystem, excellent portfolio signal. TypeScript enforces schema contracts between frontend and backend. |
| **Frontend Build Tool** | Vite | CRA, Webpack, Parcel | Fastest dev server, native ESM, excellent HMR, modern default. CRA is deprecated. |
| **Primary Database** | PostgreSQL 15+ | MySQL, SQLite, MongoDB | Strong relational integrity, JSONB for semi-structured data, excellent Python ORM support (SQLAlchemy), extensible with pgvector. |
| **Vector Store** | pgvector (PostgreSQL extension) | Qdrant, ChromaDB, Weaviate | Eliminates a separate service. pgvector is sufficient for a regulatory document corpus (<100K chunks). Upgrade path to Qdrant exists if needed. Portfolio benefit: shows infrastructure restraint. |
| **RAG Sparse Retrieval (BM25)** | rank_bm25 (Python library) | Elasticsearch, Typesense | rank_bm25 runs in-process. No extra service. Combined with pgvector for hybrid retrieval. Sufficient for <100K regulation chunks. |
| **Embedding Model** | BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 (via sentence-transformers) | OpenAI embeddings, Cohere | Free, local, no API key, strong benchmark performance, runs on CPU. Can upgrade to OpenAI if quality is insufficient. |
| **LLM (Explanation)** | Configurable: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini default, Ollama (Mistral/Llama3) fallback | GPT-4o, Gemini Flash, Claude | GPT-4o-mini is cost-effective for explanations. Local Ollama fallback for offline/demo mode. LLM is ONLY used for natural-language output — never for compliance evaluation. |
| **OCR Stack** | pdfplumber (primary) + pytesseract/doctr (fallback) | AWS Textract, Google Vision, PaddleOCR | pdfplumber handles digital PDFs natively. pytesseract/doctr for scanned fallback. Fully local, no API cost. |
| **DXF Parser** | ezdxf | libdxfrw, custom | Python-native, actively maintained, handles DXF R12–R2018, entity-aware, good layer/block support. |
| **IFC Parser** | ifcopenshell | xBIM (C#) | Python-native. IFC is deferred to v2 — architecture accommodates it via the ingestion adapter pattern. |
| **Geometry Library** | Shapely + NumPy | GDAL, OpenCASCADE | Shapely provides polygon operations, intersection, area, buffer. NumPy for matrix/line math. Together they cover all geometric compliance needs. |
| **CV Library (Mode A)** | OpenCV (cv2) | scikit-image, PIL | Full classical CV pipeline — threshold, morphology, Hough, contour. CPU-only. Well-documented. |
| **Graph Library** | NetworkX | igraph, graph-tool | Python-native, excellent for medium-scale spatial graphs (<10K nodes), readable API, good visualization export. Performance is not a concern at MVP scale. |
| **Rule Representation** | Hybrid: YAML (simple thresholds) + Python classes (complex spatial/graph) | AST/DSL, JSON only, pure Python | YAML allows non-engineers to inspect/modify numeric thresholds. Python classes handle rules that require geometry traversal. Both implement the same `ComplianceRule` interface. |
| **Task Queue / Async** | FastAPI BackgroundTasks (MVP) → Celery + Redis (when needed) | Celery from day 1, RQ, Dramatiq | For MVP: DXF parsing + compliance for a typical floor plan takes 2–15 seconds. BackgroundTasks + WebSocket polling is sufficient. Add Celery when multi-user concurrent load demands it. |
| **File Storage** | Local filesystem (MVP) → MinIO (production) | AWS S3, GCS, DB BLOBs | Local filesystem for development and demo. MinIO is S3-compatible and Docker-deployable. Architecture uses an abstract storage interface — swap without changing business logic. |
| **Authentication** | Optional JWT (MVP: configurable no-auth mode) | OAuth2, Full RBAC, No auth | No-auth mode for demo/portfolio. JWT scaffolding in place so auth is one config flag away. Do not block core analysis workflow behind auth complexity. |
| **Floor-Plan Renderer** | SVG (primary) | Canvas (Konva.js), WebGL | SVG is DOM-native, CSS-styleable, accessible, and excellent for technical drawings. React components can directly interact with SVG elements (click, hover). Canvas is better for very large drawings (10K+ elements) — not an MVP concern. |
| **Deployment** | Docker Compose (local + demo) | Kubernetes, bare metal, Vercel | Single `docker-compose up` for full stack demo. Portfolio-friendly: reviewers can run it locally. Add cloud VM config for production hosting if needed. |
| **Containerization** | Docker + Docker Compose | Podman | Standard, well-understood, good recruiter familiarity. |
| **Report Generation** | WeasyPrint (PDF from HTML/CSS) | ReportLab, LaTeX, Puppeteer | Python-native, produces styled PDFs from Jinja2 HTML templates. No headless Chrome dependency. |
| **ORM** | SQLAlchemy 2.x (async) + Alembic | Tortoise ORM, Django ORM | SQLAlchemy is the Python standard. Async support with asyncpg driver. Alembic for schema migrations. |

## PART 1 — EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BuildWise AI is a Python-backed, React-fronted architectural analysis platform that ingests formal architectural drawings (DXF, vector PDF) and hand-drawn sketches, extracts their spatial structure into a normalized internal representation, performs deterministic compliance analysis against a curated subset of building regulations, visualizes violations geometrically, and generates structured compliance reports with explainable recommendations.

**The platform is NOT:**
- A structural engineering tool
- A statutory compliance authority
- A replacement for a licensed architect
- A generative design tool
- A BIM platform

**The platform IS:**
- An AI-assisted compliance screening tool
- An architectural drawing analysis platform
- A regulatory knowledge tool backed by RAG
- A spatial graph analysis platform
- A portfolio-quality demonstration of ML + backend + frontend engineering

**MVP in one sentence:** Upload a DXF floor plan → extract geometry → build room graph → run NBC Part 4 / Part 8 compliance rules → visualize violations on the floor plan → download a PDF report.

## PART 2 — PRODUCT DEFINITION

### 2.1 Product Name
**BuildWise AI**

### 2.2 Tagline
*"Intelligent Architectural Analysis and Regulatory Compliance Screening."*

### 2.3 Core Value Proposition
> Upload any architectural floor plan. Instantly understand its spatial structure, identify potential regulatory violations, and receive actionable recommendations — before engaging statutory authorities.

### 2.4 What the System Does

1. **Ingests** architectural drawings in multiple formats
2. **Extracts** spatial entities (walls, rooms, doors, windows, stairs, exits)
3. **Normalizes** them into a format-independent canonical geometry representation
4. **Builds** a room/circulation graph
5. **Runs** deterministic compliance rules from NBC 2016 (Part 4 + Part 8) and configurable local rules
6. **Identifies** violations and maps each violation back to specific geometry
7. **Explains** violations in plain language (LLM-assisted, not LLM-evaluated)
8. **Generates** structured JSON + human-readable PDF reports
9. **Provides** a regulatory knowledge interface (RAG-backed chat for regulation queries)

### 2.5 What the System Explicitly Does NOT Do

- Issue official compliance certificates
- Perform structural calculations
- Guarantee permit approval
- Replace site inspection
- Automatically modify or optimize floor plans
- Support IFC in MVP
- Simulate thermal, acoustic, or energy performance

---

## PART 3 — TARGET USERS

### Primary
- **Architecture students** validating their designs
- **Junior architects** screening plans before formal submission
- **Engineering portfolio reviewer / technical recruiter** evaluating the candidate who built this

### Secondary
- **Building approval consultants** pre-screening projects
- **Real-estate developers** checking basic compliance early in design cycle

### Anti-persona
- Licensed structural engineers performing statutory sign-off (they need certified software)
- Municipal authority reviewers (they have their own systems)

## PART 9 — CANONICAL FLOOR-PLAN DATA MODEL (CGM)

This is the most important internal schema. Every ingestion adapter must produce this. Every engine consumes it. It is independent of input format.

### 9.1 Python Pydantic Schema

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Optional
from uuid import UUID, uuid4
from enum import Enum

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# PRIMITIVE GEOMETRY
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────

class Point2D(BaseModel):
    x: float  # meters
    y: float  # meters

class LineSegment(BaseModel):
    start: Point2D
    end: Point2D

class Polygon2D(BaseModel):
    vertices: list[Point2D]  # ordered, closed (last point ≠ first point)
    holes: list[list[Point2D]] = []  # interior holes (e.g. columns)

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────
# ENTITY TYPES
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────

class ConfidenceLevel(str, Enum):
    HIGH = "high"

### 9.2 Why This Schema

- **Format-independent:** Compliance engine never knows if data came from DXF or image
- **UUID-keyed:** Frontend can reference specific entities for visualization
- **Confidence-aware:** Allows UI to show uncertainty without hiding data
- **Shapely-compatible:** All coordinates are in meters, compatible with Shapely operations
- **Extensible:** `properties: dict` on rooms allows domain-specific metadata without schema changes
- **Multi-floor ready:** `CGMFloor` array supports multi-story buildings from day one

---

## PART 10 — GEOMETRY ARCHITECTURE

### 10.1 Coordinate System

- All internal coordinates in **meters** (regardless of input units)
- Origin (0,0) at bottom-left of drawing bounding box after normalization
- Y-axis: up is positive (standard mathematical convention)
- DXF may use arbitrary units → normalize at ingestion time using `INSUNITS` header

### 10.2 Spatial Operations (via Shapely)

| Operation | Purpose | Shapely API |
|---|---|---|
| Room area | Compliance check (min room area) | `Polygon.area` |
| Room perimeter | Ventilation ratio | `Polygon.length` |
| Wall-room intersection | Assign walls to rooms | `Polygon.intersection` |
| Door-wall assignment | Link openings to rooms | `Point.distance(LineSegment) < threshold` |
| Corridor width | Minimum width along medial axis | `Polygon.buffer` + medial axis approx |
| Bounding box | Spatial indexing | `Polygon.bounds` |
| Containment | "Does room contain centroid?" | `Polygon.contains(Point)` |

### 10.3 DXF Extraction Logic

```
ezdxf ModelSpace entities:
  LINE, LWPOLYLINE, POLYLINE → wall candidates (by layer)
  ARC, CIRCLE → roundel features (doorswings)
  HATCH → room fill areas (if present)
  TEXT, MTEXT → labels and dimensions
  INSERT (block references) → doors, windows, stairs (symbol detection)
  DIMENSION → dimension annotations

Layer heuristics (configurable):
  "WALL", "WALLS", "A-WALL" → wall entities
  "DOOR", "DOORS", "A-DOOR" → door entities
  "WINDOW", "WIN", "A-WIND" → window entities
  "STAIR", "STAIRS" → stair entities
  "TEXT", "ANNO" → annotation entities
```

### 10.4 PDF Extraction Logic

Vector PDFs are parsed with `pdfplumber`:
- Extract all line segments (paths) from PDF content stream
- Filter by stroke width (walls are typically thicker)
- Group collinear short segments into wall lines
- Detect closed regions as candidate rooms
- Extract text elements as labels
- **Limitation:** PDF has no semantic layer structure — all extraction is heuristic

### 10.5 Mode A — Image Pipeline Detail

```
INPUT IMAGE (PNG/JPG/scan)
      ↓
1. PREPROCESSING
   - Grayscale conversion
   - CLAHE contrast enhancement
   - Gaussian blur (denoise)
   - Resize to fixed DPI equivalent

2. BINARIZATION
   - Otsu's global threshold (primary)
   - Adaptive threshold (fallback for uneven lighting)
   - Sauvola threshold (for faded/low-contrast sketches)

3. MORPHOLOGICAL CLEANUP
   - Closing (fill small gaps in walls)
   - Opening (remove noise artifacts)
   - Dilation then erosion for line continuity

4. LINE DETECTION
   - Probabilistic Hough Line Transform (cv2.HoughLinesP)
   - Parameter tuning: minLineLength, maxLineGap, threshold
   - Filter near-zero-length segments

5. ORTHOGONAL SNAPPING
   - Cluster lines by angle (0°, 90° ± tolerance)
   - Snap non-orthogonal lines to nearest orthogonal
   - Merge overlapping collinear segments
   - Extend lines to intersections

6. CONTOUR/REGION EXTRACTION
   - Flood fill from detected room seeds
   - cv2.findContours on closed regions
   - Filter by area (remove noise regions)

7. VECTORIZATION
   - Convert pixel-space coordinates to meters using detected scale
   - If no scale bar detected: request user input
   - Output: list of wall segments + room polygons

8. CONFIDENCE ASSIGNMENT
   - Line confidence: based on Hough vote count + length
   - Room confidence: based on closure completeness
   - Overall: flag rooms with <70% boundary confidence as UNCERTAIN

OUTPUT → CanonicalFloorPlan (same schema as Mode B)
```

**Uncertainty handling:**
- Elements with LOW confidence are marked `confidence: "low"` in CGM
- Frontend renders them with a distinct visual style (e.g., dashed, muted color)
- Compliance checks on LOW confidence entities produce warnings, not hard violations
- User is prompted: "Some elements could not be reliably detected. Please review."

## PART 11 — GRAPH ARCHITECTURE

### 11.1 Graph Model

```
NODES:
  type: "room"     → represents a room (area, label, room_type)
  type: "corridor" → represents a corridor (width, length)
  type: "stair"    → represents a staircase (connects floors)
  type: "exit"     → represents a building exit (final node in egress paths)
  type: "lobby"    → entry/exit lobby

NODE ATTRIBUTES:
  id: UUID (maps to CGMRoom.id / CGMStair.id)
  label: str
  area: float (m²)
  centroid: (x, y)
  floor_level: int
  is_exit: bool
  room_type: RoomType

EDGES:
  Connects nodes that are accessible to each other via:
  - Door (type: "door", width: float)
  - Passage/opening (type: "passage", width: float)
  - Staircase (type: "stair_connection", floor_delta: int)
  - Corridor (type: "corridor_connection")

EDGE ATTRIBUTES:
  width: float (m) — narrowest point of the connection
  distance: float (m) — Euclidean distance between centroids (used for travel distance)
  opening_id: UUID — maps back to CGMOpening for visualization
  is_fire_rated: bool
  floor_from: int
  floor_to: int
```

### 11.2 Graph Algorithms

| Algorithm | Purpose | NetworkX function |
|---|---|---|
| Dijkstra (weighted by distance) | Travel distance to nearest exit | `nx.dijkstra_path_length` |
| BFS from exit nodes | Exit reachability | `nx.bfs_edges` |
| Dead-end detection | Corridors/rooms with only one connection | degree == 1 + corridor type check |
| Connected components | Detect isolated rooms | `nx.connected_components` |
| Minimum spanning tree | Circulation efficiency heuristic | `nx.minimum_spanning_tree` |

### 11.3 Multi-Floor Graph

```
Floor 0 graph + Floor 1 graph
↓
Staircase nodes added to each floor
↓
Inter-floor edges: stair node (floor 0) ↔ stair node (floor 1)
  - edge type: "vertical_connection"
  - distance: floor height estimate (default 3.0m if not provided)
↓
Exit nodes on Floor 0 are the terminal nodes for egress analysis
↓
All-pairs travel distance computed for every room to its nearest exit
```

### 11.4 Graph → Frontend Serialization

```json
{
  "nodes": [
    {
      "id": "uuid-room-1",
      "label": "Bedroom 1",
      "type": "room",

## PART 12 — COMPLIANCE ENGINE ARCHITECTURE

### 12.1 Design Principle

```
Rule is ALWAYS a Python object.
Rule ALWAYS evaluates deterministically.
Rule NEVER calls an LLM.
Rule ALWAYS returns a structured ComplianceResult.
LLM only generates the human-readable explanation AFTER the rule has run.
```

### 12.2 Base Rule Class

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from dataclasses import dataclass
from enum import Enum
from uuid import UUID

class Severity(str, Enum):
    CRITICAL = "critical"     # Building cannot be approved
    MAJOR = "major"           # Significant violation, must be fixed
    MINOR = "minor"           # Suboptimal, should be fixed
    WARNING = "warning"       # Heuristic recommendation
    INFO = "info"             # Informational annotation

@dataclass
class ViolationGeometry:
    """Maps a violation back to specific geometry for frontend highlighting."""
    entity_type: str           # "room", "wall", "corridor", "stair", "opening"
    entity_id: UUID            # CGM entity UUID
    geometry_hint: str         # "boundary", "centroid", "line", "area"
    coordinates: list[dict]    # [{x, y}, ...] for frontend rendering

@dataclass
class ComplianceResult:
    rule_id: str
    rule_title: str
    passed: bool
    severity: Severity
    measured_value: float | None
    required_value: float | None
    unit: str | None
    message: str               # Short technical message
    recommendation: str | None # What to do to fix it
    regulation_source: str     # "NBC 2016, Part 4, Clause X.Y.Z"
    evidence: dict             # Raw measurements used in evaluation
    violations: list[ViolationGeometry]  # Empty if passed
    confidence: str            # "high", "medium", "low" (from input data quality)

class ComplianceRule(ABC):
    rule_id: str
    title: str
    description: str
    severity: Severity
    regulation_source: str
    regulation_section: str

    @abstractmethod
    def check(
        self,
        floor_plan: CanonicalFloorPlan,
        graph: nx.Graph | None = None,
        context: dict | None = None
    ) -> list[ComplianceResult]:
        """Evaluate the rule. Return one result per violation instance."""
        ...

    def get_yaml_params(self) -> dict:
        """Return parameters loaded from YAML for this rule's thresholds."""
        ...
```

### 12.3 YAML Rule Configuration

```yaml
# yaml_rules/dimension_thresholds.yaml
rules:
  - rule_id: "NBC-4-CW-001"
    param: min_corridor_width_m
    value: 1.0
    unit: "meters"
    source: "NBC 2016, Part 4, Clause 4.2.1"
    severity: "critical"
    note: "REQUIRES SOURCE VERIFICATION — value pending cross-check with NBC 2016 document"

  - rule_id: "NBC-4-SW-001"
    param: min_stair_width_m
    value: 1.0
    unit: "meters"
    source: "NBC 2016, Part 4, Clause 4.5.2"
    severity: "critical"
    note: "REQUIRES SOURCE VERIFICATION"

  - rule_id: "NBC-4-DW-001"
    param: min_door_width_m
    value: 0.9
    unit: "meters"
    source: "NBC 2016, Part 4, Clause 4.3.1"
    severity: "major"
    note: "REQUIRES SOURCE VERIFICATION"
```

### 12.4 MVP Rule Set

> **Critical note:** All numerical values below are marked `[REQUIRES VERIFICATION]` unless the exact NBC 2016 clause has been independently confirmed. We will NOT fabricate regulatory values.

| Rule ID | Title | Source | Input | Logic | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| NBC-4-CW-001 | Minimum Corridor Width | NBC 2016, Part 4 | corridor.width | width ≥ 1000mm | CRITICAL | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-SW-001 | Minimum Stair Width | NBC 2016, Part 4 | stair.width | width ≥ 1000mm (residential) | CRITICAL | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-DW-001 | Minimum Door Width | NBC 2016, Part 4 | opening.width | width ≥ 900mm (main doors) | MAJOR | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-TD-001 | Maximum Travel Distance | NBC 2016, Part 4 | graph: max_dist_to_exit | dist ≤ 30m (sprinklered), 22m (unsprinklered) | CRITICAL | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-DE-001 | Dead-End Corridor | NBC 2016, Part 4 | graph: dead_end_length | dead_end ≤ 6m | MAJOR | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-EX-001 | Minimum Exit Count | NBC 2016, Part 4 | count(exits) per floor | exits ≥ 2 (occupancy > threshold) | CRITICAL | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-RH-001 | Riser Height | NBC 2016, Part 4 | stair.riser_height | 150mm ≤ riser ≤ 190mm | MAJOR | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-TR-001 | Tread Depth | NBC 2016, Part 4 | stair.tread_depth | tread ≥ 250mm | MAJOR | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-8-WF-001 | Window-to-Floor Ratio (Daylight) | NBC 2016, Part 8 | room.window_area / room.floor_area | ratio ≥ 10% | WARNING | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-8-VF-001 | Ventilation Opening Ratio | NBC 2016, Part 8 | room.vent_area / room.floor_area | ratio ≥ 5% | WARNING | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |
| NBC-4-CA-001 | Maximum Compartment Area | NBC 2016, Part 4 | floor.total_area | area ≤ limit by occupancy | MAJOR | REQUIRES VERIFICATION |

**Each rule requires:**
- PASS test case (compliant geometry)
- FAIL test case (violating geometry)
- EDGE CASE test (exactly at threshold)

### 12.5 Rule Engine Orchestration

```python
class ComplianceEngine:
    def run(self, floor_plan: CanonicalFloorPlan, graph: nx.Graph) -> list[ComplianceResult]:
        results = []
        for rule in self._load_rules():
            try:
                rule_results = rule.check(floor_plan, graph)
                results.extend(rule_results)
            except RuleEvaluationError as e:
                results.append(self._make_error_result(rule, e))
        return results
```

Rules are discovered via a plugin registry — adding a new rule file requires no change to `engine.py`.

## PART 13 — RAG / REGULATORY ARCHITECTURE

### 13.1 RAG Pipeline

```
DOCUMENT INGESTION:
  PDF (digital)  → pdfplumber → structured text + page metadata
  PDF (scanned)  → pytesseract / doctr → OCR text
  
  ↓
  
STRUCTURAL CHUNKING:
  - Split by section headings (regex on NBC section numbering: "4.2.1", "Table 4.1")
  - Chunk size: ~400–600 tokens with 50-token overlap
  - Preserve: section_id, page_number, document_id, version
  
  ↓
  
METADATA ENRICHMENT:
  Each chunk tagged with:
  {

  rank_bm25 Python library
  Built in-memory at startup from regulation_chunks table
  Rebuilt when new documents ingested

### 13.2 pgvector vs Qdrant Decision

**Recommendation: pgvector (PostgreSQL extension)**

| Factor | pgvector | Qdrant |
|---|---|---|
| Infrastructure complexity | None (same PG instance) | Additional service + port |
| Python SDK | psycopg2/asyncpg | qdrant-client |
| Hybrid search | Manual (BM25 separate) | Built-in |
| Performance | Good up to ~1M vectors | Better at 1M+ vectors |
| Demo simplicity | `docker-compose up` — one service | Two services |
| Regulatory corpus size | <50K chunks (manageable) | Would shine at scale |
| Portfolio signal | Shows restraint / pragmatism | Shows knowledge of specialized tools |

**Decision:** pgvector for MVP. The NBC 2016 + Part 8 corpus will produce at most ~30,000 chunks. pgvector with HNSW indexing handles this trivially. Note pgvector in your architecture document. Add Qdrant as a noted upgrade path.

**BM25 with pgvector:** Implemented via `rank_bm25` Python library, in-process. No Elasticsearch needed.

### 13.3 LLM Authority Boundaries (Enforced in Code)

```python
# This is a hard architectural boundary — not a guideline

class LLMClient:
    """
    The LLM client is ONLY used for:
    1. Generating natural-language violation explanations
    2. Answering regulatory questions via RAG
    3. Summarizing retrieved regulation text
    
    The LLM MUST NOT:
    - Evaluate numerical compliance ("is 800mm wide enough?")
    - Call any compliance rule functions
    - Return structured ComplianceResult objects
    - Make pass/fail determinations
    
    All compliance evaluation happens in ComplianceEngine BEFORE LLM is called.

## PART 14 — AI/ML ARCHITECTURE

### 14.1 ML Component Classification

| Component | Approach | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Sketch binarization | Deterministic (Otsu/adaptive) | No training data needed, reliable for clean sketches |
| Line detection | Deterministic (Hough) | Well-understood, explainable, sufficient for MVP |
| Room segmentation (Mode A) | Deterministic (flood fill + contour) | Avoids ML dependency for MVP |
| Room segmentation (Mode B DXF) | Deterministic (ezdxf layer parsing) | DXF has explicit structure |
| Entity classification | Deterministic (layer heuristics) | DXF layers encode entity type |
| Text extraction from drawings | pdfplumber / pytesseract | Libraries handle this without custom ML |
| Regulation extraction | RAG + LLM interpretation | Rules extracted from documents, human-reviewed |
| Compliance evaluation | Deterministic Python ONLY | ML is inappropriate for legal/regulatory evaluation |
| Egress analysis | Deterministic (Dijkstra) | Graph algorithms are exact |
| Violation explanation | LLM (GPT-4o-mini / Ollama) | NLG task appropriate for LLM |
| Regulatory Q&A | RAG + LLM | Retrieval + generation task |
| Corridor width measurement | Deterministic (Shapely + medial axis) | Geometry computation |

**ML is used only where it genuinely adds value and cannot be replaced by deterministic code.**

### 14.2 Embedding Model

- **Model:** `BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5`
- **Library:** `sentence-transformers`
- **Dimensions:** 1024
- **Hardware:** CPU inference (200–500ms per batch of 32 chunks — acceptable for ingestion, not per-query)
- **Query encoding:** ~20ms per query on CPU (acceptable)
- **Alternative if CPU too slow:** `BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5` (768d, 2x faster)

### 14.3 LLM Configuration

```python
# Configurable at runtime via environment variable
LLM_PROVIDER = env("LLM_PROVIDER", default="openai")

providers = {
    "openai": OpenAIClient(model="gpt-4o-mini"),
    "ollama": OllamaClient(model="mistral:7b-instruct"),
    "anthropic": AnthropicClient(model="claude-haiku"),
    "mock": MockLLMClient()  # for testing without API calls
}
```

### 14.4 Future ML Extension Points

The architecture is designed so these components can be swapped in later:

| Extension Point | Future Enhancement | Current Placeholder |
|---|---|---|

### 15.3 Notes on Schema Design

- **No separate Room/Wall/Door tables** — the canonical floor plan is stored as JSONB in `floor_plan_snapshots`. This avoids a deeply normalized schema for data that is consumed and displayed as a unit, not queried relationally by individual entity.
- **Violations link to entity UUIDs** — these are CGM entity UUIDs embedded in the JSONB, giving the frontend everything it needs to render violation overlays.
- **pgvector** replaces a separate vector database. The `regulation_chunks.embedding` column is an HNSW-indexed `vector(1024)`.
- **Reports store file paths** — large binaries (PDF) are stored on disk/MinIO, not in the DB.

## PART 16 — API ARCHITECTURE

### 16.1 API Design Principles

- REST-only for MVP. GraphQL adds complexity without benefit at this scale.
- All routes prefixed: `/api/v1/`
- OpenAPI/Swagger auto-generated by FastAPI
- Pydantic request/response schemas for every endpoint
- WebSocket for job status streaming

### 16.2 Route Map

### 16.3 Key Response Schemas (Pydantic)

```python
class AnalysisStatusResponse(BaseModel):
    run_id: UUID
    status: str
    stage: str | None
    progress_pct: int
    message: str | None
    started_at: datetime | None

## PART 17 — ASYNC PROCESSING ARCHITECTURE

### 17.1 MVP: FastAPI BackgroundTasks + WebSocket

**Decision:** Use `FastAPI BackgroundTasks` for MVP.

**Rationale:**
- A typical DXF floor plan (residential, 1 floor, ~200 entities): **2–8 seconds**
- A complex multi-floor DXF (~500 entities): **10–20 seconds**
- Vector PDF (requires more heuristic processing): **5–15 seconds**
- Mode A image pipeline: **3–10 seconds**

These durations do NOT require a distributed task queue for a single-user or low-concurrency demo. Adding Celery introduces Redis as a dependency, complicates Docker Compose, and adds failure modes without benefit at MVP scale.

**Upgrade trigger:** Add Celery when: (a) concurrent users exceed 5, or (b) processing takes >60 seconds routinely.

### 17.2 Job Status Model

```python
# In-memory job store for MVP (upgrade to Redis-backed for Celery)
class JobStatus(BaseModel):
    job_id: UUID
    status: Literal["queued", "processing", "complete", "failed"]
    stage: str
    progress_pct: int
    message: str
    created_at: datetime
    updated_at: datetime
    result_id: UUID | None  # AnalysisRun ID on completion
    error: str | None

# Stages emitted during processing:
STAGES = [
    ("validating",      5,  "Validating file..."),
    ("parsing",         20, "Parsing {format} file..."),
    ("extracting",      40, "Extracting spatial entities..."),
    ("building_graph",  55, "Building room connectivity graph..."),
    ("compliance",      70, "Running compliance rules..."),
    ("rag_explain",     80, "Generating explanations..."),
    ("reporting",       90, "Building report..."),
    ("complete",        100,"Analysis complete."),
]
```

### 17.3 WebSocket Protocol

```
Client → Server: {"type": "subscribe", "job_id": "uuid"}
Server → Client: {"type": "status", "job_id": "uuid", "stage": "parsing", "progress": 20, "message": "..."}
Server → Client: {"type": "complete", "job_id": "uuid", "run_id": "uuid"}
Server → Client: {"type": "error", "job_id": "uuid", "message": "..."}
```

### 18.4 Visual Design System

- **Mode:** Dark (default) with light mode toggle
- **Primary palette:** Deep graphite (`#0F1117`) + Electric indigo (`#6366F1`) + Emerald (`#10B981`)
- **Typography:** Inter (Google Fonts) — professional, technical, legible
- **Severity colors:** Red `#EF4444` (critical), Amber `#F59E0B` (major), Yellow `#EAB308` (minor), Slate `#64748B` (info)
- **Floor plan background:** `#1E2030` with grid lines in `#2D3148`
- **No excessive animations** — subtle transitions only (200ms ease)
- **Data-dense but not cluttered** — information hierarchy is strict

### 18.5 Frontend State Management

```
Zustand stores:
  useAuthStore       ← user, token, isAuthenticated
  useProjectStore    ← current project, analysis runs
  useAnalysisStore   ← current run, violations, floor plan data
  useFloorPlanStore  ← selected floor, selected room, selected violation
  useJobStore        ← live job status (WebSocket-driven)
  useRAGStore        ← conversation history, loading state
```

## PART 19 — FLOOR PLAN VIEWER ARCHITECTURE

### 19.1 SVG vs Canvas Decision

**Decision: SVG for MVP**

| Factor | SVG | Canvas |
|---|---|---|
| DOM interaction | Native (click, hover on elements) | Manual hit-testing |
| Accessibility | Screen-reader compatible | Not accessible |
| Scalability | Good up to ~5,000 elements | Better at 50,000+ |
| CSS styling | Full CSS support | Manual render |
| Animation | CSS transitions | requestAnimationFrame |
| React integration | Direct JSX elements | imperative API |
| Violation overlays | CSS class switching | Manual redraw |
| Export to SVG file | Trivial (serialize DOM) | Canvas.toDataURL (raster) |

**Verdict:** A residential floor plan has <500 drawing elements. SVG is ideal. Canvas becomes necessary only at architectural-scale buildings with thousands of entities.

### 19.2 SVG Data Contract (Backend → Frontend)

The backend `/api/v1/analysis/{run_id}/floor-plan` endpoint returns:

See Section 19.3 for the full contract.

### 20.1 Rendering Strategy per Violation Type

| Violation Type | Geometry Element | Visual Representation |
|---|---|---|
| Corridor too narrow | Room polygon (corridor) | Red semi-transparent fill + border |
| Travel distance exceeded | Graph path | Red dashed line along egress route |
| Dead-end corridor | Room polygon | Orange fill + dead-end icon |
| Exit inaccessible | Exit node | Red X marker at exit position |
| Insufficient window area | Room polygon | Yellow hatch pattern fill |
| Stair width too narrow | Stair polygon | Red border + measurement label |
| Door too narrow | Opening indicator | Red door symbol |
| Riser/tread violation | Stair polygon | Amber fill |

### 20.2 Violation Severity Colors

```css
--violation-critical: rgba(239, 68, 68, 0.35);   /* red */
--violation-major:    rgba(245, 158, 11, 0.35);   /* amber */
--violation-minor:    rgba(234, 179, 8, 0.25);    /* yellow */

## PART 22 — SECURITY ARCHITECTURE

### 22.1 File Upload Security

```python
ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = {".dxf", ".pdf", ".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg"}
MAGIC_BYTES = {
    ".dxf":  None,          # DXF is text-based; validate first line
    ".pdf":  b"%PDF-",      # PDF magic
    ".png":  b"\x89PNG",    # PNG magic
    ".jpg":  b"\xff\xd8\xff" # JPEG magic
}
MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES = 50 * 1024 * 1024  # 50 MB

def validate_upload(file: UploadFile) -> ValidationResult:
    # 1. Check extension
    # 2. Read first 8 bytes, check magic
    # 3. Check total size
    # 4. Generate safe filename (UUID-based, no path components)
    # 5. Store in isolated temp directory
```

### 22.2 Storage Security

- Uploaded files stored at: `storage/{user_id}/{project_id}/{uuid4}{extension}`
- No user-controlled path components in storage paths
- Temp files cleaned up after processing (or on failure)
- Files never served directly from the backend; presigned URLs or streaming download via API only

### 22.3 API Security

- All endpoints except `/api/v1/auth/*` require authentication (when auth is enabled)
- User can only access their own projects/analysis runs
- Project-level data isolation enforced in all SQL queries (always filter by `user_id`)
- Rate limiting: `slowapi` (FastAPI rate limiting library)
- CORS configured to frontend origin only

### 22.4 DXF/PDF Processing Safety

- DXF files are processed by ezdxf in a stateless function (no execution of embedded scripts)
- PDF files are processed by pdfplumber (does not execute embedded JavaScript)
- Large files: streaming processing with memory limits
- Malformed files: caught by try/except, return structured error, clean up temp file

### 22.5 Data Isolation

- Multi-user: all queries include `WHERE project.user_id = current_user.id`
- Uploaded files: stored in user-scoped subdirectory
- Analysis runs: ownership checked at API layer before any DB query
- No cross-user data exposure in any response schema

### 23.2 Compliance Rule Test Pattern

```python
# tests/unit/test_compliance_rules/test_corridor_width.py

class TestCorridorWidthRule:
    def test_pass_case(self, floor_plan_factory):
        """Corridor exactly at minimum (1000mm) must pass."""
        plan = floor_plan_factory.with_corridor(width_m=1.0)
        results = CorridorWidthRule().check(plan)
        assert all(r.passed for r in results)

    def test_fail_case(self, floor_plan_factory):
        """Corridor below minimum (750mm) must fail with CRITICAL severity."""
        plan = floor_plan_factory.with_corridor(width_m=0.75)
        results = CorridorWidthRule().check(plan)
        assert any(not r.passed for r in results)
        assert any(r.severity == Severity.CRITICAL for r in results)
        assert results[0].measured_value == pytest.approx(0.75)
        assert results[0].required_value == pytest.approx(1.0)

    def test_edge_case(self, floor_plan_factory):
        """Corridor at exactly 999mm (1mm under) must fail."""
        plan = floor_plan_factory.with_corridor(width_m=0.999)
        results = CorridorWidthRule().check(plan)
        assert any(not r.passed for r in results)
```

### 23.3 Synthetic Test Floor Plans

Create a set of synthetic DXF floor plans covering:
- Simple 1-floor residential (baseline)
- Multi-floor residential
- Floor plan with deliberately narrow corridors (fail case)
- Floor plan with excessive travel distance (fail case)
- Floor plan with dead-end corridors (fail case)
- Floor plan with missing exits (fail case)
- Floor plan with insufficient window area (fail case)
- Perfect compliant floor plan (all pass)

These are stored in `tests/fixtures/floor_plans/` and are the ground truth for integration tests.

## PART 24 — EVALUATION STRATEGY

### 24.1 Geometry Extraction Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure | Dataset Needed |
|---|---|---|
| Wall detection recall | (walls detected / total walls in ground truth) | Annotated DXF test set |
| Room detection F1 | Precision × recall for room polygons | Annotated floor plans |
| Room area error | Mean absolute error vs ground truth area | Annotated floor plans |
| Opening detection recall | Doors/windows found vs ground truth | Annotated floor plans |
| IoU (rooms) | Overlap of detected polygon vs ground truth polygon | Annotated floor plans |

**Dataset status:** *Requires creation.* Use synthetic DXF files with known ground truth. CubiCasa5k images can be used for Mode A evaluation.

### 24.2 Compliance Engine Metrics

| Metric | Definition |
|---|---|
| True Positive | Rule correctly flags a real violation |
| True Negative | Rule correctly passes a compliant design |
| False Positive | Rule incorrectly flags a compliant design |
| False Negative | Rule misses a real violation |
| Precision | TP / (TP + FP) |
| Recall | TP / (TP + FN) |

**Measurement approach:** Run compliance engine against synthetic test floor plans with known violation status. Each rule needs at least 3 test cases.

### 24.3 System Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target | Measurement |
|---|---|---|
| DXF analysis latency (simple) | < 10 seconds | benchmark test |
| DXF analysis latency (complex) | < 30 seconds | benchmark test |
| Mode A image pipeline | < 15 seconds | benchmark test |
| RAG query latency | < 3 seconds | benchmark test |
| API response time (non-analysis) | < 200ms | load test |
| Memory usage (analysis pipeline) | < 1 GB | profiling |

### 24.4 RAG Metrics

| Metric | How to Measure |
|---|---|
| Retrieval relevance | Manual evaluation of top-5 retrieved chunks per query |
| Citation accuracy | Does citation section number match the retrieved text? |
| Groundedness | Does LLM answer only use information from retrieved chunks? |
| Answer correctness | Manual expert review of sampled Q&A pairs |

**Dataset status:** *Requires question set creation.* Create 20–30 regulation questions with expected answers from NBC 2016.

- LLM client (OpenAI + Ollama abstraction)
- Violation explanation generation
- RAG Q&A endpoint
- Integration tests: ingestion → retrieval accuracy

### Phase 5 — Report Engine (Week 15–16)

- JSON report schema + generator
- Jinja2 HTML report template
- WeasyPrint PDF generation
- Annotated floor plan in report (SVG embedded)
- API endpoints: download JSON + PDF reports

### Phase 6 — Frontend (Week 17–20)

- Design system: CSS variables, typography, colors
- Layout: analysis workspace (3-panel)
- SVG floor plan viewer: pan, zoom, room polygons, walls, openings
- Violation overlay rendering
- Left panel: floor navigator + room list
- Right panel: violation detail + recommendation
- Bottom panel: compliance summary + tabs
- Processing progress UI (WebSocket integration)
- Dashboard + project management pages
- RAG chat panel
- Report download UI

### Phase 7 — Integration, Testing, Polish (Week 21–24)

- End-to-end tests: full pipeline

## PART 28 — RISKS

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| DXF layer naming inconsistency | HIGH | MEDIUM | Layer heuristics + user-configurable layer mapping |
| PDF vector extraction is too heuristic | HIGH | MEDIUM | Accept lower accuracy; mark entities with confidence; fallback to user correction |
| Mode A (sketch) quality is insufficient for compliance | MEDIUM | LOW | Mode A outputs CGM with `confidence: low`; compliance runs but results are advisory |
| NBC clause values incorrect (we invented numbers) | HIGH | HIGH | All values marked `REQUIRES VERIFICATION`; implement a regulation review step before shipping rules |
| BGE embedding quality insufficient for legal text | LOW | MEDIUM | Evaluate retrieval quality; fallback to OpenAI embeddings if needed |
| LLM generates incorrect explanations | MEDIUM | LOW | LLM only explains pre-computed results; monitor output, add disclaimers |
| WeasyPrint PDF rendering issues | LOW | LOW | Well-tested library; CSS print layout has known quirks; test early |
| Multi-floor graph complexity | MEDIUM | MEDIUM | Single-floor is default; multi-floor is opt-in; test with simple 2-floor synthetic case |
| Corridor width measurement accuracy (Mode A) | HIGH | MEDIUM | Use Shapely medial axis approximation; mark as heuristic; require confidence >= medium |
| Scope creep (adding features during dev) | HIGH | HIGH | Strict MVP scope; anything not in Phase 0–6 is deferred to roadmap |

## PART 29 — INTENTIONAL TECHNICAL DEBT

We are consciously accepting the following shortcuts for MVP:

| Debt | Accepted Because | Remediation Path |
|---|---|---|
| FastAPI BackgroundTasks instead of Celery | Sufficient for demo/portfolio concurrency | Add Celery + Redis when multi-user load demands it |
| pgvector instead of Qdrant | No infrastructure overhead; sufficient at MVP scale | Qdrant if vector corpus exceeds 500K chunks |
| No cross-encoder reranker deployed | BGE + BM25 hybrid is sufficient for MVP | Add `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` in Phase 4 polish |
| Floor plan stored as JSONB (not normalized tables) | Analysis reads CGM as a unit; normalization adds no query benefit | Migrate to normalized tables if we need entity-level queries |
| No auth in demo mode | Speeds up portfolio demo; avoids login friction | JWT is scaffolded; enable with config flag |
| Local filesystem storage | Simpler Docker setup | Abstract storage interface allows swap to MinIO with no code change |
| BM25 index rebuilt in-memory | Fast enough for <100K chunks | Move to persistent BM25 index (disk-backed) at scale |
| Mode A produces uncertain geometry | Classical CV limitation | Replace with deep learning segmentation in v2 |
| NBC rules need source verification | We don't fabricate values | Manual review of NBC 2016 document before each rule goes live |

## OPEN QUESTIONS (Genuinely Require Your Answer)

> I have made sensible defaults for everything I could. Only these items fundamentally change the architecture:

### OQ-1 — NBC Regulatory Source Access

> **Do you have access to the NBC 2016 PDF?**

If yes: we can ingest it for RAG and verify rule values from the document.  
If no: we need to use publicly available summaries + mark all values as `REQUIRES VERIFICATION` until verified.

This affects Phase 4 (RAG) and all compliance rule threshold values.

### OQ-2 — LLM API Key Availability

> **Will you use OpenAI/Gemini/Anthropic API keys for development and demos, or do you need fully local LLM (Ollama)?**

The architecture supports both, but the default prompt engineering and quality are tuned for GPT-4o-mini. If local-only, we default to Ollama + Mistral 7B and accept lower explanation quality.

### OQ-3 — Authentication Requirement

> **For the initial portfolio demo: no-auth mode (single user, no login required) or JWT auth?**

My recommendation: **no-auth for the first working demo.** JWT scaffolding is in place and can be enabled by a config flag. This lets reviewers run the demo without registering.

Do you agree?
